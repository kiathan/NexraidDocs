# Nexraid Product Support Lifecycle
## Product Support Phase
### Phase 1: Mainstream Support
Mainstream Support starts on the release date and lasts up till one year after the next product version is released. All support services are available during this phase.

### Phase 2: Extended Support
Extended Support starts when Mainstream Support ceases and lasts for a specific duration (usually one year or until the next-but-one product version is released). Limited support services are provided.

### Phase 3: Self-Service Support / End of Life
Self-Service Support is available over the course of a product's lifecycle and until the end of the Extended Support phase. It includes Nexraid online Knowledge Base articles, FAQs, troubleshooting tools, and other resources to help customers resolve common issues. Nexraid does not promise content accuracy after Extended Support phase.

## Important Considerations
1. A solution or workaround is provided at Nexraid's discretion. If the issue is resolved in the newer version, an upgrade is considered a valid solution.
2. The bugfix will be added to the Product Roadmap. A fix is not guaranteed for all software defects. Triage and fix are at Nexraid's discretion.
3. Nexraid provides full support for the three latest minor versions of the product. Customers are encouraged to update to the latest available build to ensure they have the most stable and secure version of the product.
4. Customers wishing to receive more support offerings during a product's extended support phase — e.g. Nexraid Customer Support and developer investigation of product hotfixes/patches for selected issues of any severity level — should contact their dedicated account manager or regional sales representative to determine the most appropriate support program for their organization’s needs.
5. During the trial period, support is only provided for the current version of the product.
