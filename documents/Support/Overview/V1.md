# Nexraid Support Overview
1. With every Nexraid product subscription, Nexraid Support provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and licensing support. Support is available through both email and online support portal for both paid and trial subscriptions. With an active enterprise support agreement, instant messaging and phone support are also available.
2. Authorized administrators can use the online support portal to submit service requests online and view all open and recently closed service requests. Service requests submitted in the online support portal can be reopened for up to 14 days after the request has been closed. For instructions, see Contact Nexraid support.
3. The Nexraid technical support team troubleshoots only those issues that are related to product with a valid license or support plan.

## Shared Support Responsibilities

### Customerâ€™s Role and Responsibilities
People with administrator roles are the only ones in the customer's organization authorized to access the configurations and to communicate directly with Nexraid about service requests. You can designate different service administrators who serve different functions.

   * Use Nexraid's self-service support resources to resolve support issues.

However, if the administrator is unable to resolve issues with the help of self-service support resources, he or she should [contact Nexraid Technical Support](https://docs.nexraid.com/Support/Contact-Options).

### Nexraid Support Role
