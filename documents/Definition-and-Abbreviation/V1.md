# Definition
Throughout NexRaid Documentation, the definition of:

## A
### Audit Logs
Audit Logs is an audit trail (also called audit log) is a security-relevant chronological record, set of records, and/or destination and source of records that provide documentary evidence of the sequence of activities that have affected at any time a specific operation, procedure, or event.


## C
### Computer Security
Same as [System Security](#System-Security).

### Cybersecurity
Same as [System Security](#System-Security).

## D

### Data Breach
Data breach is the intentional or unintentional release of secure or private/confidential information to an untrusted environment. Other terms for this phenomenon include unintentional information disclosure, data leak, information leakage and also data spill. Incidents range from concerted attacks by black hats associated with organized crime, political activist or national governments to careless disposal of used computer equipment or data storage media and unhackable source.

### Data Processors
Data Processors is any person, other than an employee of the Data Controller who processes Personal data on behalf of a Data Controller, i.e. third parties that process or handle Personal data on our behalf.



## I
### Information Security
the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion/destruction, corruption, modification, inspection, recording or devaluation, although it may also involve reducing the adverse impacts of incidents.

### Information Technology Security
Same as [System Security](#System-Security).

## N
### Network security
Network security consists of the policies and practices adopted to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.

## O
### Outsourcing
Outsourcing is an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for a planned or existing activity that is or could be done internally, and sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another.

### Operating Procedure
Same as [Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)](#Standard-Operating-Procedure-SOP).

## P

### Physical Security
Physical security describes security measures that are designed to deny unauthorized access to facilities, equipment and resources and to protect personnel and property from damage or harm.

### Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
Privacy Impact Assessment is (PIA) a type of impact assessment conducted by an organization (typically, a government agency or corporation with access to a large amount of sensitive, private data about individuals in or flowing through its system). The organization audits its own processes and sees how these processes affect or might compromise the privacy of the individuals whose data it holds, collects, or processes.


## R

### Removable Media
Removable media is a form of computer storage that is designed to be inserted and removed from a system.

### Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is the combined effort of:
1. identifying and analyzing potential events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment;
2. making judgments "on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis" while considering influencing factors.

## S

### Software Development
Software Development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.

### Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
Standard Operating Procedure is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out complex routine operations. SOPs aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing miscommunication and failure to comply with industry regulations.


### System Security
System Security is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.


## T
### Third-party Source
Third-party source means a supplier (or service provider) who is not directly controlled by either the seller (first party) nor the customer/buyer (second party) in a business transaction. The third party is considered independent from the other two, even if hired by them, because not all control is vested in that connection. There can be multiple third-party sources with respect to a given transaction, between the first and second parties. A second-party source would be under direct control of the second party in the transaction. In Information Technology, Third Party Suppliers is a supplier of software (or a computer accessory) which is independent of the supplier and customer of the major computer product(s).

## U

### “User”
  1. all employees (permanent or temporary); and
  2. any other person engaged to work on behalf of Nexraid in relation to its business activities, including any persons engaged through third parties or directly as a consultant, worker or agent.
